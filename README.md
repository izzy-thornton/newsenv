###Data Output Format

When you run a query in NewsEnv, results are exported to Excel (.xlsx) or CSV (.csv) files. Each row represents a single news article returned by the query.

**Columns**

-title

--The headline of the article as published.

-pubdate

--The publication date of the article, when available (format: MM/DD/YYYY). This field may be blank if the source does not provide a publication date.

-date_collected

--The exact timestamp when the article was retrieved by NewsEnv (ISO 8601 format with timezone info). This allows reproducibility and shows when the dataset was generated.

-url

--The direct link to the full article.

-summary

--A short text summary or snippet of the article content (as returned by the search service).

-keywords

--Automatically extracted keywords from the article content, stored as a list of terms. These are useful for thematic analysis, quick filtering, or word cloud generation.

-FullText

--The full body text of the article as collected. Use this field for in-depth text analysis, coding, or natural language processing.

**Example Row**

| Column        | Example Value                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **pubdate**   | (blank)                                                                       |
| **date_collected** | 2025-07-17 13:43:59.926                                                  |
| **url**       | https://abcnews.go.com/                                                       |
| **summary**   | Taco Bell launches Refrescas as new premium beverages‚Ä¶                        |
| **keywords**  | ['summer', 'expands', 'menu', 'refrescas', ...]                               |
| **FullText**  | Full article text                  

**Notes on Usage**

-Some fields (like pubdate) may be missing or incomplete depending on the source.
-To ensure reproducibility, always cite both the pubdate (if available) and the date_collected.
-Keyword extraction is automated and may include duplicates, variants, or lowercased terms.
-If running multiple queries, you may want to concatenate exports and use date_collected to filter by time period.

###PDF Report Format

In addition to the CSV/Excel data exports, NewsEnv also generates a PDF summary report. This file provides a quick, human-readable overview of your search results.

Each PDF report includes:

-Title & Metadata

-Report title (‚ÄúNews Coverage Report: Custom Search‚Äù)

-Date the report was generated

-The exact search query that produced the results

-Links to the corresponding CSV and XLSX data files

-Total number of articles retrieved

-Keyword Analysis
--A ranked list of the Top 10 Keywords extracted from the collected articles
--Keywords are listed with their frequency counts (e.g., ‚Äútaco: 676, bell: 573, chicken: 273‚Äù)
