Aline N., brand manager of beverages, said in a press release that the new drinks take inspiration from aguas frescas, a popular beverage in Mexico and Latin America.

Liz Matthews, Taco Bell’s global chief food innovation officer, said in another release that the chain is “making big investments” to make its drinks as beloved as its food.

As part of this investment, it will open 30 more new Live Más Cafés — its drinks-focused spinoff restaurant — inside of existing Taco Bell restaurants starting in Southern California, Dallas and Houston, Texas by the end of 2025.

When it comes to new menu items, Taco Bell consistently delivers and rarely misses. At Taco Bell’s Live Más Live 2025 in March, the fast food chain revealed plans to introduce dozens of new menu items this year—and so far, they’ve delivered.

Over the last few months, Taco Bell has debuted Crispy Chicken tenders, tacos, and burritos nationwide, a whole new beverage lineup and café concept, and just announced the launch of a new Sweet Chipotle BBQ Sauce. Now, more innovations from the test kitchen are hitting markets, including a brand-new spin on the beloved value menu featuring five new Taco Bell creations.

Taco Bell Is Testing a New Luxe Value Menu

After teasing new menu items and meal deals at Live Más Live, Taco Bell is delivering on its promise with the chain's newest drop: the Luxe Value Menu. Just like the original Luxe Cravings Boxes, the new lineup is packed with the TB flavors and formats you know and love for $3 or less each.

From handheld stacks to loaded sides, the new Taco Bell Luxe Value Menu satisfies every craving without sacrificing flavor or compromising value. And while the Luxe Value Menu delivers five craveable favorites, it also includes a brand-new innovation of a beloved Taco Bell classic.

Taco Bell

The Luxe Value Menu offers solid options to eat solo or pair with a Crunchwrap Supreme and Baja Blast, all at an incredible price. First up is the Chipotle Ranch Chicken Stacker, which features grilled all-white-meat chicken with a combo of Avocado Ranch Sauce and creamy Chipotle Sauces, all folded into Taco Bell’s signature Stacker format. The Beefy Potato Loaded Griller is packed with seasoned beef, crispy potato bites, Nacho Cheese Sauce, Chipotle Sauce, and reduced-fat sour cream for a handheld roll-up that’s easy to grab and go.

The menu also includes one of Taco Bell’s most stocked sides yet: Chips & Nacho Supreme Dip. The indulgent dip features layers of seasoned beef, beans, the chain’s signature Nacho Cheese Sauce, sour cream, pico de gallo, and a three-cheese blend, all served with tortilla chips for easy scooping and satisfying crunch.

Taco Bell's Brand-New Mini Taco Salad

Hands down, the standout on the Luxe Value Menu is the new Mini Taco Salad, which is proof that bigger isn’t always better. This innovative take on a fan-favorite was first previewed at Live Más Live, and features seasoned beef, Chipotle Sauce, Cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and refried beans in a crispy, golden mini tortilla bowl.

And since the best menus always have dessert options, the new Luxe roundup also features Salted Caramel Churros. These crispy-on-the-outside and creamy-on-the-inside churros are perfectly baked and dusted with salted caramel sugar for a satisfying sweet treat.

While these five menu items are delicious as is, the new Luxe additions will be available alongside existing favorites, including the Cheesy Roll Up, Spicy Potato Soft Taco, Cheesy Bean & Rice Burrito, Three-Cheese Chicken Flatbread, and the Cheesy Double Beef Burrito. And since each menu item costs $3 or less, it’s easy to mix and match favorites with maximum satisfaction at a minimal cost.

The only caveat? The chain is currently testing its Luxe Value Menu at select locations across the Indianapolis area starting July 17, while supplies last. Once the test period concludes, there’s a chance Taco Bell will debut the menu—including the new Mini Taco Salad—to restaurants nationwide, assuming test customers approve. After trying the salad for myself (and loving it) at Live Más Live, I’m hoping that the good people of Indiana can help out, because you don’t want to miss out on this one."

Taco Bell is giving its value menu a serious glow-up and fans in certain areas are getting the first taste. The chain just launched a Luxe Value Menu test that brings bold flavor, indulgent formats and fast food innovation together for a price point that’s almost too good to be true. How good? Everything on the new test menu is $3 or less. As a big Taco Bell stan, I cannot wait.

If the words “mini taco salad” just made your ears perk up, you’re not alone. That’s one of five brand-new creations being served up as part of the test menu, alongside options like the Chipotle Ranch Chicken Stacker, Beefy Potato Loaded Griller, Chips & Nacho Supreme Dip and Salted Caramel Churros. These new items are joining value-menu all-stars including the Cheesy Bean & Rice Burrito, Spicy Potato Soft Taco and the fan-favorite Cheesy Rollup. My mouth is watering.

The whole idea behind the Luxe Value Menu is to bring elevated flavor without sacrificing affordability. Taco Bell is calling it “value without compromise,” and the new lineup definitely leans into indulgent, crave-worthy territory.

And yes, that Mini Taco Salad is already generating buzz—it was first teased at Live Más LIVE and features seasoned beef, chipotle sauce, cheddar, refried beans, lettuce and tomatoes in a crispy tortilla bowl. Other highlights include the Chipotle Ranch Chicken Stacker with double sauces and the Beefy Potato Loaded Griller packed with nacho cheese and crispy potato bites.

Even the dessert is getting a luxe upgrade: The Salted Caramel Churros are dusted in sweet-salty sugar and filled with creamy goodness.

The Luxe Value Menu is currently only available at select locations in the Indianapolis area for now, but it’s a test worth keeping an eye on. If the response is anything like other fan-fueled launches, there’s a good chance it could expand nationwide.

So if you’re in Indy, now’s your chance to get your hands on Taco Bell’s next big thing before it’s gone. And if you’re not? Fingers crossed this luxe lineup hits your local drive-thru soon.

How much are Taco Bell Refrescas?

The Agua Refrescas cost $3.99 for a 20-ounce drink while the Rockstar Energy Refrescas cost $4.49 for a 20-ounce beverage. The Refrescas Freezes are available in a 16-ounce or 20-ounce option and cost $3.79 and $3.99, respectively.

Why is Taco Bell adding Refrescas to the menu?

Taco Bell is seemingly going after younger consumers searching for fresh beverage options.

“We’re seeing today that people, especially younger consumers, are reaching for refreshing drinks as part of their lifestyle, whether it’s for energy or a sweet treat throughout the day,” said Liz Matthews, Taco Bell’s Global Chief Food Innovation Officer, in the June 26 news release. “So, we’re making big investments to become the ultimate beverage stop where our fans can expect to see the same bold, unexpected creativity in their cups as they do on their plates.”

Taco Bell Refrescas do contain caffeine ranging from 52 mg to 200 mg. Healthy adults can generally consume up to 400 mg of caffeine per day without negative affects, according to the FDA. However, the FDA warns about heavy consumption of caffeine among children. ""Too much caffeine in children and teens can cause increased heart rate, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, anxiety, and lead to sleep problems, digestive problems and dehydration,"" the FDA says.

Taco Bell also debuts Crispy Chicken Tacos, Burritos and Strips

In addition to the new beverages, Taco Bell also announced last month that Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos will be available at locations nationwide for a limited time.

Both items feature a Crispy Chicken Strip inside and are available with new Spicy Ranchero and Avocado Ranch sauces.

For $2.79, the Crispy Chicken Tacos layers its new crispy strip with purple cabbage, lettuce, pico de gallo and shredded cheddar cheese. Meanwhile, the Crispy Chicken Burrito includes two strips, purple cabbage, crisp lettuce, pico de gallo and cheddar cheese for $5.49.

The chain is also offering two Crispy Chicken Strips for the price of $3.99, not to be confused with its Crispy Chicken Nuggets, which debuted last December and returned in April.

Next, take it easy with the hot sauce (at least at first). Start with a few squirts, mix it in, and give it a taste to see how it suits your spice tolerance. Remember that Diablo Sauce is spicier, but Fire Sauce still brings heat, too. You could even try mixing both to see how the flavors interact. And make sure to stir thoroughly — we're not just topping nacho cheese with hot sauce here, we're trying to create a completely new sauce. Aim for a uniform, orange hue.

Try dipping a quesadilla into it, spreading it thick over a Crunchwrap Supreme, or loading up some hash browns for a spicy and cheesy breakfast twist.

Taco Bell has been busy doing what it does best—revamping its menu with one bold new item after another. Recently, the brand rolled out its take on the beloved Snack Wrap, introducing a crispy chicken taco and burrito, paired with an all-new Spicy Ranchero Sauce. And there’s even more in the works, including a Crispy Cheese Triple Stacked Taco and a Steak & Cheese Tacodilla currently in the testing phase.



But even with all that innovation happening behind the scenes, Taco Bell hasn’t put its collabs on the back burner. In recent months, the brand has teamed up with Mike’s Hot Honey for a spicy-sweet take on Diablo Sauce and launched Birthday Cake Churros with Milk Bar.



Now, Taco Bell is rolling out a brand-new partnership—and this time, it’s not with a fellow food brand. It’s with a cultural icon. And instead of just adding another item to the menu, it's switching up the whole way you experience it.



Taco Bell Launches a New Value Meal with Tony Hawk

Yes, that Tony Hawk—the legendary pro skater who’s been a household name for decades. Even if you’ve never touched a skateboard, you probably know who he is—and now, he’s teaming up with Taco Bell to give you even more reason to remember his name.



Introducing: Tony Hawk’s Build Your Own Luxe Cravings Box (BYOLCB), a custom meal deal based on his favorite Taco Bell lineup. As he put it, he once had a ""self-imposed Taco Bell allowance"" that he ""practically lived on"" in his early skating days. So it’s only fitting that he’s now helping fans stretch their Taco Bell dollars, too.



If you’re not familiar with the Luxe Cravings Box, it’s a value meal deal that bundles up fan-favorite items at $5, $7, and $9 price points. Most boxes feature set combos, but the BYOLCB is different: as the name suggests, you get to build your own. Customers can choose one Taco Bell specialty item, a taco or burrito, a side, and a medium drink, all for one set price (which varies by location).



A lifelong Taco Bell fan, Tony Hawk has crafted his own all-star order over the years. His custom Luxe Cravings Box includes all of his go-tos: a Cheese Quesadilla, a Crunchy Taco, Chips & Nacho Cheese Sauce, and a medium Lipton Iced Tea.



The collab also comes with an additional perk for gamers. In celebration of the release of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 on July 11, every in-app order of any Luxe Cravings Box—including Tony’s version—unlocks exclusive in-game gear.



Here’s what you can get:

July 18–24: Taco Bell Hoodie



July 25–31: Taco Bell Sweatpants



August 1–7: Verde Grip Tape



August 8–13: Taco Bell Puffer Vest



Tony Hawk’s custom BYOLCB is available now exclusively through the Taco Bell app and website. And for one day only—July 8—you can try his build with a 50 percent off BYOLCB Tuesday Drop when you order through the app. So, whether you’re here for the nostalgia, the value, or the in-game swag, this limited-time collab is one you won’t want to miss.

New Yorker Steven Marks, who opened his fast casual Mexican concept in 2006 in Australia, has grown it to over 250 locations and is ready to take on the U.S. market.

July 11, 2025 by Cherryh Cansler — Editor, FastCasual.com

Australia isn't exactly a hotbed for Mexican cuisine, which might explain why Collins Foods, Taco Bell's Australian franchisee, is exiting the business. However, it doesn't account for the success of Guzman Y Gomez, a Mexican chain founded 20 years ago in Australia by New York native Steven Marks.

Collins Foods, which is Australia's largest operator of KFC restaurants, opened its first Taco Bell in 2017, but announced in April 2025 that it was seeking an exit strategy over the next 12 months. Although it had planned to open 50 locations by 2021, it now has fewer than 30, citing problems, including issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Guzman Y Gomez, on the other hand, is thriving with over 250 locations in Australia, Singapore and Japan, and is now focused on adding to the six units operating in the U.S. In April, it reported a total network sales of $289.5 million ($188.175 million USD), a growth of 23.6% in Q3 2025.

Although the menu features calorie-rich fare like fries, burritos and nachos, Marks said GYG is committed to serving fresh food and will never compromise on its ""clean"" menu.

""Australians take their food seriously, especially when it comes to clean, fresh food prepared daily, and we get that,"" he said in an interview with FastCasual. ""We don't have microwaves in our restaurants, and we never will. When other U.S. brands entered the Australian market, they brought over a legacy model with frozen ingredients, centralized kitchens and a dated approach to fast food. We took a different approach.""

Unlike its competitors, GYG uses no added preservatives, artificial flavors, colors or additives.

""We've built real trust around the ingredients on our menu and the freshness of them, which is why we've been able to grow the way we have while others have struggled,"" said Marks, who chatted with FastCasual about how the brand will mirror its global success in the U.S. See below:

Q. How do you stay true to a ""health-forward approach"" when offering items like fries and nachos?

Marks: For 18 years, GYG has never compromised on who we are or our food. If you want to be successful, you cannot take shortcuts. Restaurants today need to wholeheartedly believe in what they're selling. I have always had a vision to reinvent fast food because I genuinely believe that fast food doesn't have to mean bad food.

At GYG, it's all about ingredients and preparation. When I was looking at the fast food market around us, I saw that people were using fries that were only 70% potato. I kept asking what the other 30% was? It's why when we started serving fries at GYG, I made sure they were 100% skin-on potato cooked in high-quality oil with no other nasty ingredients. Even our nachos use real corn chips, freshly melted cheese and high-quality meats that are marinated in-house. We worked tirelessly to make our corn chips perfect, going through 21 versions to get them just right and to GYG standards. Just because they are delicious, doesn't mean they are not clean. We hold everything on our menu to the same standard. I also have to mention our incredible flank steak. We pay a higher price for the best quality meats because we will never compromise on the quality of our food.

Q. Being from NY, why did you launch the brand in Australia instead of the US?

Marks:When I moved to Sydney in the early 2000s, I quickly realized that I missed the Mexican food from back home, and there was a real gap in the market. Growing up in New York I was surrounded by incredible Mexican food. When starting GYG, I wanted to do it the right way. I flew in Mexican chefs to help create and develop the menu and worked closely with suppliers within Australia and Mexico to give us the best and freshest ingredients to eventually bring the energy and flavor to Australia, just done the right way!

Q. Why the focus on US growth now?

Marks: We've proven ourselves in Australia, Japan and Singapore; we have seen incredible success at over 250 restaurants. Now, we are bringing the brand to the US to show Americans that fast food doesn't have to mean bad food. The US market is so big that it supports mediocrity, and people are okay with that. This gives GYG a prime opportunity to expand with a fresh approach to Mexican fast food and serve guests in a way that's convenient for them in dine in, take out, drive thru, delivery, app and web and catering. We also serve breakfast, lunch and dinner which is a massive point of difference for us.

We're not here to be another name in a crowded space, we're here to redefine what fast food can be. We are fast food for the next generation; you can have quality, speed, Clean food and great value all at one restaurant.

Why is Chicago the launchpad for US growth?

Marks: I have spent a lot of time in Chicago, and you can tell it is a food-obsessed city. It's packed with foodies who appreciate high-quality ingredients and amazing flavors which is why it was the perfect choice for us.

After we opened GYG Naperville back in 2020, we have seen momentum in our other Chicagoland locations — Schaumburg, Crystal Lake, Buffalo Grove, Deerfield and Evanston — with Des Plaines coming up next. The landscape of the Chicagoland area has given us a strong foundation in both drive-thru and strip restaurant sites in Chicagoland and beyond. Since opening Naperville, every location has outperformed our expectations, and we're just getting started.

Q. How is your menu adapting to meet consumer changes — Gen Zers and Millennials snacking more and wanting more innovative beverages, for example?

Marks:More than ever guests are educating themselves on what food they are consuming. Across the world we are seeing the younger generations come to GYG as they know they can get fresh, authentic food, customized the way they want. Gen Z and Millennials want real food, fast. Not fake health food, not freezer-to-fryer shortcuts, and they want options, which is exactly why GYG is fast food for this next generation.



We have seen that individual health goals, preferences and hunger levels can vary which is why we have designed our menu to accommodate these needs. At GYG, everything is customizable. You want double protein? Done. Swap rice for lettuce? No problem. Going meat-free and want veggies and guac instead? Absolutely. We make it fresh, we make it clean and we make it fast. And this flexibility doesn't just stop there. Every main item on our menu comes in both regular and ""Mini"" sizes so you're not committing to a regular-size burrito when you're just looking for a quick bite. And if you just want a snack? Our $2.50 taco hits every time. (These give guests more flexibility, perfect for those who want a lighter meal or are watching portion sizes, while still enjoying the same great GYG flavors and value. For example, a regular burrito weighs 530 grams, while the mini version comes in at 285 grams.)



But what really sets us apart is our full daypart offering, not just lunch and dinner. GYG is where you can roll through the drive-thru at 7 a.m. for a barista-made coffee and a Bacon & Egg Burrito, or chill inside with a Horchata Latte and Churro after class. We're there for your whole day.

It's why we're building a real following that is resonating with so many young people. We're not showing off with gimmicks, but with food that Gen Z and Millennials actually want to eat.

Q. What about tech? Are you using kiosks or mobile ordering?

Marks: Our mobile app allows for ordering, customization and GOMEX reward points, so every dollar you spend gets you money off your next purchase. You can even now order delivery on the GYG app, straight to your door and right now, can get free delivery if you spend $10 or more.

However, making every guest love us is one of our values. The in-person experience and greeting guests with a warm ""Hola, welcome in!"" when they walk through the doors is part of what makes GYG what we are today! It's hard to substitute that energy with kiosks, so we always focus on and emphasize the in-person experience.

Q. What else should we know?

Marks: We're not just building another Mexican fast-food chain, we're reinventing the fast-food industry. At Guzman y Gomez, we serve real, clean food made with authentic Mexican flavors, delivered at the pace and convenience of traditional fast food, without ever compromising on quality.



Where else can you get a barista-made coffee and a freshly prepared Bacon & Egg Breakfast Burrito at 7 a.m., then come back for $2.50 tacos and a Churro Sundae at 11 p.m.? GYG is designed to fit your life, morning, afternoon and late-night.

And we'll prove it! Walk into any GYG and you feel it immediately- the energy, the warmth, the music, the food and the people. Our crew brings the vibe, and our guests bring the community.



We're not a build-your-own bowl factory. We're about unique flavors, slow-cooked meats that have marinated for days, hand-prepped ingredients and a menu that is built for real flavor, real freshness, and real cravings, all served by a crew that is loving what they're doing.

Whether you're hitting the drive-thru for coffee before work, ordering a quick lunch on our state-of-the-art app, or bringing the family in for a dinner that's both clean and craveable, GYG meets you where you are. And we do it with zero shortcuts.

You can taste the difference, and you can feel that we will never compromise on our food, our people or the guest experience.

The chicken wrap, which returned to McDonald's menus on July 10 nearly a decade after the item was phased out, has sparked a wrap war: some fast-food chains, like Burger King, are reminding fans they've had wraps for years, and others, like Popeyes and Taco Bell, recently added their own versions to their menus.

McDonald's wrap, available a la carte or in a combo meal, is available in two flavors: spicy and ranch. The combo meal comes with two Snack Wraps, a medium fry and a drink of choice. If you're only ordering the wrap, the item costs $2.99 each.

IRVINE, Calif., June 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Taco Bell has always delivered bold, craveable, and affordable meals—and now the brand is taking value to new heights with skateboarding icon and lifelong fan, Tony Hawk. We've tapped Tony Hawk to share his take on the Build Your Own Luxe Cravings Box (BYOLCB): a full-sized, flavor-packed meal, made for fans who know exactly what they want. Even better? Starting July 11, the box unlocks unique in-game item drops for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater™ 3 + 4—available for a limited time only through the Taco Bell app.

Taco Bell continues to lead the value game by teaming up with skateboarding icon Tony Hawk to share his take on the Build Your Own Luxe Cravings Box (BYOLCB).

""At Taco Bell, delivering bold flavor at unbeatable value for our fans isn't a trend—it's part of our DNA"" said Taco Bell's Chief Marketing Officer, Taylor Montgomery. ""We're seeing 1 in 5 Luxe Cravings Boxes being scooped up by Taco Bell first timers, meaning our value is not just satisfying cravings—it's so compelling it's bringing new fans. Now, we're turning it up another notch with this epic collaboration proving that craveability and value aren't mutually exclusive.""

From Skater Fuel to Full-Circle Feast

Tony knows how to push limits—on the board and on a budget. A 12-time national champ, gold medalist, and the first to land the 900, his impact on skating is legendary. And when every dollar counted, Taco Bell's unbeatable value made it possible for him to eat like a champ on a skater's budget.

Now, Taco Bell is honoring that legacy with a new box that lets fans eat like Tony and live más for less. Fans can make every dollar go pro—just like Tony did back in the day and eat like a legend with his customized Build Your Own Luxe Cravings Box.

Tony Hawk's BYOLCB is a modern-day nod to the iconic Taco Bell meals that fueled his early skate sessions—packed with some of his all-time favorites like a Cheese Quesadilla, Crunchy Taco, Chips & Nacho Cheese Sauce, and a medium Lipton® Iced Tea to top it off.

""Taco Bell was my fuel in the early days of Birdhouse. It kept me going while I was chasing a dream,"" said Tony Hawk. ""I had a self-imposed Taco Bell allowance and practically lived on it while creating a brand and skating nonstop. So, getting to create my own box with Taco Bell along with co-creating a line of new in-game features is my version of living the dream. I hope it inspires others chasing their passion to keep pushing, keep grinding, and maybe grab a taco along the way.""

As part of the collaboration, Taco Bell has also teamed up with Uber Eats to launch the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Bundle – available on the Uber Eats app for a limited time (the only delivery platform carrying it!). Mirroring the Tony Hawk's Build Your Own Luxe Cravings Box, the bundle brings unbeatable craveability and convenience straight to your doorstep.

Plus, fans who order the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Bundle on Uber Eats will have access to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater™ 3 + 4 demo codes and can enter a Sweepstakes sponsored by Uber Eats for a chance at other amazing prizes. Terms apply. See Uber Eats app for details.

This time around, players can spot Taco Bell restaurants in the background of select skate maps, bringing the collab to life in-game. Taco Bell's also taking the collab beyond the box. Starting July 11, every in-app order of a $5, $7, or $9 Luxe Cravings Box—or Tony Hawk's take on the Build Your Own Luxe Cravings Box—unlocks a unique in-game item each week.

A flour tortilla wrapped around a ground beef tostada and stuffed with lettuce, tomatoes, nacho cheese and sour cream, the item has become essential for American consumers who like their Mexican food cheap and gimmicky — which is to say, basically everyone (birria ramen, anybody?). The Times has offered multiple articles on how to make your own version at home. Celebrity chefs like Matty Matheson have shot videos praising Crunchwrap Supremes while hawking their own takes. Its June anniversary will soon get the star treatment in a national publication for a story in which I was interviewed because I’m literally the guy who wrote the book on Mexican food in the United States.

But there was a slight problem that needed to be rectified before I sounded off on the legendary dish: I had to try a Crunchwrap Supreme for the first time.

Hell, before a few weeks ago, I had only visited Taco Bell thrice in my life.

Taco Bell captured a shift in L.A.’s taco psyche

During the 1980s and 1990s, Southern California underwent momentous shifts. The white middle class was fleeing the state as the defense industry and blue-collar factories collapsed; immigrants from across the globe came in to replace them, jolting the region’s politics.

Meanwhile, the ideal taco in the Angeleno psyche was transitioning from the hard-shell topped with a blizzard of yellow cheese eaten since the 1930s into the one we all love today: a tortilla — usually corn — stuffed with something and baptized with a sprinkle of salsa.

(A quick etymological aside for the kids: Tacos made with non-deep-fried tortillas used to be called “soft” tacos to differentiate them from hard-shell tacos, which were just called “tacos.” Now, it’s the reverse — progress!)

So my childhood wasn’t spent at Taco Bell, Tito’s Tacos or even Del Taco, whose half-pound bean-and-cheese burrito remains the world’s best fast-food item. My tacos were the ones at King Taco when visiting relatives in East L.A., or the Taqueria De Anda chain in Orange County back when it was still good.

I had no reason to go to Taco Bell, even as it went worldwide. Nor did it entice me to visit with its half-racist TV ads like the Taco Bell Chihuahua dog or the ones that ended with the slogan “Make a Run for the Border.” I didn’t go to one until the early 2000s, and I can’t remember what my cousins and I ordered except it was bland, limp and too salty: A bunch of regret dabbled with nada.

I stopped in only twice more: when the Irvine-based company debuted its Doritos Loco taco in 2012, and when I forced the late Times food critic Jonathan Gold to go through a Taco Bell drive-thru for an episode of the hit Netflix show “Ugly Delicious.” Both times, the experience was like my first.

The Crunchwrap Supreme did not win me over

I ordered one at a location in Santa Ana near my wife’s restaurant, where I unveiled the dish. While looking as sleek and tightly folded as a dumpling, it was far smaller than I had expected. The tortilla had no flavor; the tostada which supposedly offers textural counterpoint — the whole idea, according to its advocates, like Times newsletter jefe Karim Doumar — was soggy.

And once again, Taco Bell’s Achilles’ heel was its ground beef, which was as pebbly as gravel. I squeezed some of Taco Bell’s hot sauce to try and save my lunch, but it tasted like insulin dusted with black pepper.

You’re better off buying two of Del Taco’s half-pound bean-and-cheese burritos for the same $6 price.

I am no snob or purist — I think Jack in the Box’s hard-shell tacos are magnificent. And I can see the Crunchwrap Supreme working with better ingredients. But the dish is hardly worth the hype. Besides, Mexicans have a far better dish that combines the soft with the crunchy to create something sublime. They’re called chilaquiles — ask my fellow columnista Steve Lopez about them sometime.

Tensions over the raids are heating up

An ICE raid at a Home Depot in Hollywood shattered an immigrant refuge.

ICE agents were denied entry to the Dodger Stadium parking lot, the team said.

More L.A. car washes have been targeted, too, and some closed amid fears of further sweeps.

Reports of an immigration raid at a bus stop in Pasadena sparked outrage, and Border Patrol agents arrested another American citizen for interfering in immigration arrests.

Protesters are chasing federal agents out of L.A. County hotels.

The raids are changing California

ICE flights out of the L.A. area have more than doubled in the last month.

The Adelanto ICE Processing Center is filling so rapidly it is reigniting longtime concerns about safety conditions inside the facility.

The agency also wants to expand detention capacity in California. This new facility will be the largest in the state.

Daily life has been significantly altered around immigration hubs because of the fear and panic around the ongoing immigration raids.

Farms, hotels and restaurants have pressed Trump to exempt their businesses from raids.

Trump retains control of the National Guard

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided Thursday to leave troops in Los Angeles in the hands of the Trump administration while California’s objections are litigated in federal court.

“While the court did not provide immediate relief for Angelenos today, we remain confident in our arguments and will continue the fight,” Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said in response to the ruling.

The questions at the heart of the case test the limits of presidential authority, which the U.S. Supreme Court has vastly expanded in recent years.

Trump administration lawyers are digging deep to find statutes that can justify the ongoing federal crackdown — including constitutional maneuvers invented to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.

What else is going on

Archbishop Gomez starts to stand up for L.A. right when the city needs him, Gustavo Arellano writes.

Trump could sabotage L.A.’s World Cup and Olympics, Michael Hiltzik argues.

Social Security is still in good shape but faces challenges — from Trump, Hiltzik said in another column.

Secret police have no place in L.A. or democracy, columnist Anita Chabria writes. “But here they are.”

The History of Taco Bell

Taco Bell was founded in 1962 in California by Glenn Bell. Its story began in 1946 when he opened Bell’s Drive-In in San Bernardino. Four years later, he added a hamburger stand. In front of this stand, there was a small Mexican food stall that he visited weekly. He observed how there were always long lines of customers enjoying fried tacos.

Glenn became friends with the owner, who taught him how to make tacos. This is how Bell started offering tacos in his business until he decided to embark on an independent venture. In 1952, he partnered with someone to open a taco stand called Taco-Tia, reaching three locations. However, due to his partner’s lack of interest in expanding, he decided to sell his share.

In 1957, he partnered with three people to create El Taco, but he left the project because he preferred to make decisions on his own. Finally, in 1962, with only $4,000, he opened the first Taco Bell, whose menu only had five items: tacos, burritos, beans, tostadas, and chili burger.

Due to the success of his business, Glenn developed a plan to franchise the brand, and a year later, he sold the first franchise in Torrance, California. The business grew so much that by 1967, the chain already had 100 locations. Today, Taco Bell sells over 2 billion tacos annually and has 8,218 locations worldwide.

The new Crescent Street location is open from 7 a.m. (Taco Bell does breakfast now) to 2 a.m. It is a stand-alone Taco Bell, as opposed to the Taco Bell-KFC hybrid establishments that frequently share space.

On the menu

Recently, Taco Bell added three new menu items that will be sure to satisfy its chicken-crazed clientele. There's a brand new Crispy Chicken Burrito ($5.49), Crispy Chicken Tacos ($2.79) and Crispy Chicken Strips (2 for $3.99).

For the Taco Bell traditionalists, the chain's full menu is available at the new location. The Cheesy Gordita Crunch, Beefy 5-Layer Burrito and Crunchwrap Supreme aren't going anywhere for now."

Mini Taco Salad

The new Mini Taco Salad was first introduced during the Taco Bell Live Más LIVE event, and is now part of the new Luxe Value Menu. The Taco Salad is made with seasoned beef, Chipotle Sauce, and cheddar cheese, and fans who saw the item being teased at Live Más were sure it was too good to be true. It’s very real, and hopefully will make it to the permanent menu at some point.

Sweet Chipotle BBQ Sauce

Taco Bell’s new Sweet Chipotle BBQ sauce is available nationwide starting July 17, for a limited time only. This smoky-sweet menu item is the perfect pairing for the Crispy Chicken Tacos, Burritos and Strips. “BBQ ranks among the most-loved dipping sauces in the crispy chicken space, and while Taco Bell has dabbled in the BBQ world before, this version brings a fresh, Taco Bell-style Twist,” the chain says.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Chipotle Ranch Chicken Stacker

The Chipotle Ranch Chicken Stacker is made with grilled all-white-meat chicken, Avocado Ranch Sauce + creamy Chipotle Sauce, shredded three-cheese blend, lettuce, and tomatoes, all folded into the Stacker format. “It’s very similar to the Chipotle Ranch Chicken Burrito (also grilled), which most people lament the loss of to this day,” one Redditor said.

7 Reasons Taco Bell Is Crushing Every Other Fast Food Chain Right Now

Beefy Potato Loaded Griller

The Beefy Potato Loaded Griller was previously tested and now it’s back—so fans who were begging for its return will be very happy. “Bring back the Loaded Grillers!” one Redditor said. “Tell me these weren’t the best??!!!!! Did anyone else get the chance to taste greatness? Especially the chicken one with the spicy sauce 🤤. The beefy nacho was also great and the closest thing to that is the ‘Cheesy double beef burrito’and my only complaint about it is that they DON’T grill the burrito!!!!!!! 🌯”

Chips & Nacho Supreme Dip

Another brand new item, the Chips & Nacho Supreme Dip is made with layers of seasoned beef, beans, Nacho Cheese Sauce, reduced-fat sour cream, pico de gallo, and a three-cheese blend, served with Taco Bell tortilla chips. “Looks yummy. I’m gonna make one my next day at work!!” one employee said.

Salted Caramel Churros

Also new to the menu are the Salted Caramel Churros, a “crispy-on-the-outside, creamy-on-the-inside” churro treat, dusted in salted caramel sugar. This street food-inspired dessert is sure to be a hit with fans who are obsessed with the Milk Bar Birthday Cake Churros."

Excuse me, Taco Bell, have you heard of a little thing called “the law”? Because I’m pretty sure you’re breaking it by offering Americans thirst-quenching strawberry and passionfruit mocktails under a name that is decidedly not English.

Back in March, the great and powerful President Trump issued an executive order insisting that all Americans speak American, noting: ""Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society.”

NO THANK YOU, MR. BELL, IF THAT IS YOUR REAL NAME!

Agua Refrescas are not an acceptable MAGA beverage

On July 14, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a memo to federal agencies telling them to start getting rid of “unnecessary multilingual offerings” and saying “the Department of Justice will lead a coordinated effort to minimize non-essential multilingual services” and “redirect resources toward English-language education and assimilation.”

While the memo does not reference fast-food beverage nomenclature, I’m pretty sure it applies, as everyone knows the quickest path to assimilation is a shared love of iced mango/peach concoctions made with what USA TODAY calls “real freeze-dried fruit pieces and green tea.”

My reporting for this column took me to Google Translate, which helped decipher the mysterious foreign meaning of each word in Taco Bell’s controversial, possibly anti-MAGA new beverage. First, the word “agua” means “water.” And the word “refresca” means “refresh.”

So why, I ask, did Taco Bell officials decide to call these drinks Agua Refrescas instead of giving them a fun, patriotic, roll-off-the-tongue name like Water Refresh?

Is Taco Bell violating the law with a non-English beverage name?

The Taco Bell menu already contains a slew of good, traditionally American English words like “double beef,” “three cheese,” “loaded,” and “Crunchwrap.” And because I enjoy eating them, I will assume “taco” and “burrito” are English words as well.

So is it too much to ask that a U.S. fast-food chain allow its customers to come in and order five cheesy double beef burritos and a 20-oz. Dragonfruit Berry Water Refresh, like real damn Americans?!?

The long, radical history of aguas frescas

Further reporting revealed that agua refrescas stem from a classic Mexican beverage called agua fresca, which Texas Monthly described as having been “culturally important for a long time—so important that they were immortalized in Édouard Pingret’s 1852 painting Vendedora de aguas frescas.”

I don’t know what most of those words mean, but I do know that Taco Bell’s Agua Refrescas are transparently anti-American. A recent Los Angeles Times headline read: “These street vendors used their aguas frescas to fight tear gas at anti-ICE protests.”

What patriot wants to be caught dead drinking a beverage that could ward off the tear-gas-masked ICE agents who disperse while they’re grabbing random people off the streets and sending them to foreign prisons without due process? Not me, I’ll tell you that much.

If Taco Bell won't comply with Trump's English-only order, it must go

Look, I believe in every American’s right to pursue gastrointestinal distress, but I will not sit idly by while Taco Bell insults President Trump and his English-only executive order with this new drink. The man is busy trying to make life difficult for people who don’t look and sound exactly like me, and no deliciously fruity beverage should slow his xenophobic crusade.

It’s time to shut down Taco Bell, Mr. President. We can’t Make America Great Again while sipping Marxist mocktails called Agua Refrescas. That would be no bueno ... OH GOD, THEY GOT TO ME!!!!

However, Taco Bell’s sales have grown by nearly 98% during the same time frame, according to Technomic.
A year later (almost to the day), Taco Bell opened its first Live Más Café inside of a restaurant near San Diego.
Taco Bell is also working in earnest to ramp up its chicken presence, including with its recent Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos launch and its Crispy Chicken Nuggets.
But Taco Bell and McDonald’s have the brand equity and scale to win top-of-mind and convenience battles for such cravings and the competition between them is clearly picking up accordingly.","['mcdonalds', 'crispy', 'bell', 'bells', 'company', 'recent', 'sales', 'taco', 'heats', 'chicken', 'billion', 'competition']","Taco Bell executives often boast about the chain’s position as a “category of one,” noting that no other concepts offer items like the Crunchwrap or Nacho Fries.

But such a position implies little competition, and we all know the quick-service segment is as intense as it gets. Given Taco Bell’s recent momentum, its biggest target has more than likely shifted to McDonald’s, the country’s largest chain by sales literally for decades.

Consider this week, for instance, when McDonald’s re-launched its much-anticipated Snack Wrap. That same day, Taco Bell ran a $2.40 promotion on its new Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos. To understand this salvo, it’s important to put a lens on both chains’ recent trajectories.

In 2014, Taco Bell was the sixth largest chain in the U.S. by sales, according to Technomic, with $8.2 billion and 5,921 locations. McDonald’s was No. 1, with $35.4 billion and 14,350 locations.

By 2024, Taco Bell had moved up to No. 4, leapfrogging Wendy’s, Burger King, and Subway. The company ended last year with $16.2 billion and 7,604 locations. McDonald’s, still at the top, ended with $53.5 billion and 13,557 locations.

In other words, in the past 10 years, McDonald’s sales have grown by just over 51% — an impressive number, to be sure. However, Taco Bell’s sales have grown by nearly 98% during the same time frame, according to Technomic.

Related:Taco Bell is testing a Luxe Value Menu with items for $3 or less

Meanwhile, McDonald’s footprint is 5.5% smaller, while Taco Bell’s is 28.4% bigger.

Taco Bell’s game of catch up continued in the first quarter, with a 9% increase in same-store sales and an 11% increase in systemwide sales, versus McDonald’s 3.6% same-store sales decline and a 3% drop in overall revenue (though that figure includes global markets).

Of course, as the industry king, McDonald’s is every brand’s top target for market share gains, but Taco Bell and McDonald’s have forged particularly similar paths of late in a race to win over the same (and increasingly discerning) consumers.

Both, for instance, have pushed new value offerings in the past year, including the McValue platform for McDonald’s, and the $5, $7, $9 Luxe Box for Taco Bell. On the innovation side, both have begun heavily leaning into chicken and beverages, per rising consumer demand.

On Dec. 7, 2023, McDonald’s launched its CosMc’s concept aimed at testing products and processes focused on the beverage category. A year later (almost to the day), Taco Bell opened its first Live Más Café inside of a restaurant near San Diego.

CosMc’s has since shuttered, but McDonald’s intends to test its most popular offerings in restaurants by the end of this year, while Taco Bell has plans to expand its Live Más Café to at least 30 locations by the end of this year.

In a statement in 2024, Taco Bell chief marketing officer Taylor Montgomery said the company wants its beverages to be “as iconic as its food.” McDonald’s has created a category team focused specifically on beverage innovation, indicating that it has a similar goal.

“We are very bullish on the opportunity in beverages, and we think there's a lot of growth potential in beverages, both in coffee, whether it's hot or iced, but also in some of these other beverage areas that you're seeing emerging like refreshers, like energy drinks, etc.,” Kempczinski said during a recent earnings call.

Then there’s chicken.

McDonald’s executives have a stated goal of gaining a full percentage point of chicken market share by the end of 2026. The company is banking on its McCrispy Strips and Snack Wraps launches, as well as the occasional appearance of the Chicken Big Mac, to get there.

Taco Bell is also working in earnest to ramp up its chicken presence, including with its recent Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos launch and its Crispy Chicken Nuggets. The company has called crispy chicken “the future,” adding that it will be a permanent menu platform in 2026.

Granted there are plenty of other players jockeying for position in the intensifying value, beverage, and chicken categories. And, of course, every brand is trying to pull from the seemingly endless chicken demand well right now. But Taco Bell and McDonald’s have the brand equity and scale to win top-of-mind and convenience battles for such cravings and the competition between them is clearly picking up accordingly.

The new sauce will be available in three new menu items, as well as an add-on or side to any menu item for an additional fee.

We don’t know about you, but we felt like Taco Bell was being eerily quiet lately. Normally, the Tex-Mex chain is cooking up something new almost every week, but since its major launch of Crispy Chicken tacos, burritos, and tenders and new Agua Refrescas, we haven’t heard much from the Bell.

But, as soon as you start wondering where Taco Bell’s new releases are, the chain materializes with a new menu item—or in this case, three new menu items.

After a few months as a fan-loved menu item, Taco Bell’s Crispy Chicken offerings are getting something new. The Crispy Chicken Taco, Crispy Chicken Burrito, and plain Crispy Chicken Strips can now be paired with an all-new signature barbecue sauce. On July 17—and after years of begging from fans—Taco Bell is releasing its first-ever Sweet Chipotle BBQ Sauce.

Taco Bell Introduces New Sweet Chipotle BBQ Sauce

Taco Bell

“Taco Bell should have BBQ sauce as an add-on option,” one Reddit user posted in 2022.

“What would you put it on? They don't sell any BBQ food,” another user asked.

“Nachos. Beefy five layer. Anything that comes with nacho sauce,” wrote the original poster.

Now, thanks to its latest Crispy Chicken taco and burritos—which are topped with purple cabbage, lettuce, pico de gallo, and shredded Cheddar cheese—customers’ barbecue cravings are finally answered. In addition to ordering the tacos, burritos, and chicken strips with a side of Avocado Ranch or Spicy Ranchero, customers can now try them with Taco Bell’s new smoky, sweet, and tangy barbecue sauce.

The new Sweet Chipotle BBQ sauce is made with chipotle peppers, molasses, and spices—and even though it was developed with the crispy, tortilla chip-coated chicken in mind, it can be ordered alongside any Taco Bell favorite.

Beginning July 17, you can try the Sweet Chipotle BBQ Sauce atop the Crispy Chicken Taco and Crispy Chicken Burrito, as well as on new Sweet Chipotle BBQ Sauce Topped Fries. The new fries feature the beloved Nacho Fries topped with slow-roasted chicken, Nacho Cheese sauce, Spicy Ranch, Sweet Chipotle BBQ Sauce, Cheddar cheese, and jalapeños.

Even though barbecue sauce is one of the most-loved dipping sauces for chicken, you can also order the Sweet Chipotle BBQ Sauce on any Taco Bell menu item for an additional $0.30 or in a side cup for $0.60. So, dear Reddit users, now is your chance to add it to your nachos and Beefy 5-Layer Burrito.

However, much like the Crispy Chicken offerings, the Sweet Chipotle BBQ Sauce won’t be around forever—so get it while you can.

Black bears are remarkably adaptable animals with an extraordinary sense of smell that constantly guides them in their search for food. While they typically forage and hunt in their natural habitats, the allure of easy, high-calorie meals often draws them into urban neighborhoods. In this YouTube video, an audacious black bear steals a family’s Taco Bell order right off their front porch!

Bear Behavior and Feeding Habits

A bear’s sense of smell is so powerful that scientists don’t have a way to accurately measure its strength. ©knelson20/Shutterstock.com

Bears are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Their diet primarily consists of plants like roots, berries, and grasses. However, they will also eat animal-based protein when they can find it, including fish, insects, larvae, and meat from young elk, moose, and deer. A bear’s diet changes throughout the year, adapting to the seasons, their individual needs, and the availability of food.

Getting plenty to eat is especially important for black bears in the fall as they prepare for winter. While they don’t truly hibernate, they enter a state called torpor. This is similar to hibernation, but it is not as deep a sleep. During this time, the bears don’t forage or hunt, relying entirely on the fat reserves they built up in the fall. To pack on these essential pounds, black bears eat almost constantly during the fall, focusing on calorie-dense and nutrient-rich foods.

Black bears are opportunistic eaters and have an incredible sense of smell. The area inside a bear’s nose, called the nasal mucosa, is about 100 times larger than that of a human’s, allowing them to smell significantly better than we can. Experts believe a black bear can detect a scent from a mile or two away, or perhaps even farther. This extraordinary sense of smell helps the bears detect even the tiniest particles of odor so they can find food in both their natural habitat and human settlements.

Why Bears Choose Garbage Over the Wild

Black bears are incredibly smart and adaptable. They quickly learn and remember where to find the best food sources, including those in human neighborhoods. Human settlements often offer easy access to high-calorie foods, especially in unsecured garbage cans.

Unsecured trash is the primary reason bears come into human neighborhoods. However, they’re also attracted to other tempting scents like compost piles (especially those with meat and fruit), bird feeders, and pet food. Finding food in their natural habitat requires a lot of time and energy, but raiding a trash can or an outdoor pet food bowl is quick and efficient, saving the bear valuable time and energy.

This is particularly appealing in the fall when bears need to consume as many calories as possible to prepare for winter. Many human foods are packed with nutrients and calories, offering a much quicker and easier meal than spending hours foraging in the wild. Think of it like this: if you’re in a hurry or low on energy, grabbing a quick meal from a drive-thru is often more appealing than spending all day cooking in the kitchen.

Bears also venture into neighborhoods when their own natural food sources are scarce. This can happen in early spring when plants are just beginning to grow, or if their main food sources didn’t produce enough that year.

Human Expansion and Conflicts

Male black bears usually weigh 130 to 500 pounds. ©Pawel Serafin/Shutterstock.com

As human populations grow and expand into bear habitats, our leftover garbage becomes an even greater temptation for hungry bears. The closer our homes are to their territory, the more likely bears are to raid our trash at night. This expansion also cuts off natural pathways for bears, breaking up their usual territories and making it harder for them to find enough natural food. For a hungry and tired bear, finding easy food in urban areas is a huge incentive. With the popularity of food delivery apps that bring meals right to your front door, there is concern that food left outside could attract bears. As seen in the YouTube video, if you don’t bring your food inside quickly, a bear might get to your meal first!

Unfortunately, this close contact leads to many conflicts between humans and bears. Having wild bears in neighborhoods can be dangerous for both humans and the bears themselves. The National Park Service has a saying, “A fed bear is a dead bear.” This is because once bears get used to human areas, they can become a threat to public safety. Wildlife officials may try to capture and relocate a bear that becomes a problem in human neighborhoods, but in certain situations, they may have to euthanize it without attempting relocation.

How Human Food Harms Black Bears

In the fall, black bears eat up to 20,000 calories daily. ©JMP_Traveler/Shutterstock.com

When bears find food in human areas, they quickly associate food with humans and become “habituated.” This means they lose their natural fear and caution around humans, becoming more active in neighborhoods and looking for food wherever people are present. Bears can even change their daily routines, becoming nocturnal to avoid humans while foraging in urban areas.

Bears are also frequently hit by cars while crossing roads in search of human food. The human foods and non-food items that bears find in the trash can also make them sick. While human foods might offer more calories, they often lack the balanced diet a bear needs, leading to sickness, long-term health issues, and dental problems. The more a bear relies on humans for food, the less capable it becomes of surviving in the wild.

Preventing Human-Bear Conflicts

One of the best ways to prevent dangerous conflicts with bears in urban areas is to always secure your trash and recycling. If possible, store them in your garage overnight and only put them out on the morning of pickup. Even empty containers can attract the super-sensitive nose of a hungry bear. You can also consider getting bear-resistant garbage cans and dumpsters.

Here are more helpful ways to prevent hungry bears from coming into your neighborhood:

Remove bird feeders from April through November, as this is when bears are most active.

Never leave pet food outside overnight.

If you compost, keep it contained and enclosed, and avoid adding meat and fruit.

Make sure all birdseed, pet food, and compost are securely stored.

Thoroughly clean barbecue grills after each use and store them securely.

Promptly harvest ripe fruit from trees and pick up any fallen fruit.

The tacos and burritos are also stuffed with cabbage, lettuce, shredded cheddar, pico de gallo and a choice of Spicy Ranchero Sauce or Avocado Ranch Sauce. The burrito (typically $5.50), which has two chicken strips, is wrapped in a griddled tortilla and the taco (typically $2.80) has just one strip stuffed inside.

There was a total meltdown inside a Dearborn Heights Taco Bell when a teenager came in looking for a job application, but it ended with him in handcuffs.

Big picture view:

An 18-year-old allegedly walked in already upset, claiming he had called about a job. When he didn't get the answers he was looking for from employees, he lifted his shirt to reveal what appeared to be a pistol.

On Thursday, the man's job hunt was halted on Thursday as he was on the ground, face down, with a Taco Bell employee hopeful and a weapon in his waistband. However, upon further review by Dearborn Heights police officers on the scene, it was discovered that the weapon was a modified BB gun that looked like a Glock.

""It looked very, very real, like an actual handgun,"" said Dearborn Heights Police Chief Ahmed Haidar. ""When he removed the weapon from his waistband, we found out it was a modified BB gun that looked like a glock.""

When he allegedly walked into the Taco Bell lobby off Telegraph near Ann Arbor Trail, employees thought the gun was real.

""He was upset because he was reaching out to them to obtain an application,"" said Haidar.

Dig deeper:

The chief said the teen apparently came in looking for answers but instead scared the employees, tipped tables, and then took off. Just a few blocks away, officers stopped the suspect's stroll.

The teenager learned from officers that even flashing a BB gun can lead to legal trouble. Investigators are seeking charges of felonious assault and brandishing a firearm.

""You've got your whole life ahead of you; there's no reason to get caught in the system for something this small,"" said Haidar.

What's next:

The chief stated that they would have the request for charges sent to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office by Friday, and they would have the ultimate say on what he is charged with."

How much are Taco Bell Refrescas?

The Agua Refrescas cost $3.99 for a 20-ounce drink while the Rockstar Energy Refrescas cost $4.49 for a 20-ounce beverage. The Refrescas Freezes are available in a 16-ounce or 20-ounce option and cost $3.79 and $3.99, respectively.

Why is Taco Bell adding Refrescas to the menu?

Taco Bell is seemingly going after younger consumers searching for fresh beverage options.

“We’re seeing today that people, especially younger consumers, are reaching for refreshing drinks as part of their lifestyle, whether it’s for energy or a sweet treat throughout the day,” said Liz Matthews, Taco Bell’s Global Chief Food Innovation Officer, in the June 26 news release. “So, we’re making big investments to become the ultimate beverage stop where our fans can expect to see the same bold, unexpected creativity in their cups as they do on their plates.”

Taco Bell Refrescas do contain caffeine ranging from 52 mg to 200 mg. Healthy adults can generally consume up to 400 mg of caffeine per day without negative affects, according to the FDA. However, the FDA warns about heavy consumption of caffeine among children. ""Too much caffeine in children and teens can cause increased heart rate, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, anxiety, and lead to sleep problems, digestive problems and dehydration,"" the FDA says.

Taco Bell also debuts Crispy Chicken Tacos, Burritos and Strips

In addition to the new beverages, Taco Bell also announced last month that Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos will be available at locations nationwide for a limited time.

Both items feature a Crispy Chicken Strip inside and are available with new Spicy Ranchero and Avocado Ranch sauces.

For $2.79, the Crispy Chicken Tacos layers its new crispy strip with purple cabbage, lettuce, pico de gallo and shredded cheddar cheese. Meanwhile, the Crispy Chicken Burrito includes two strips, purple cabbage, crisp lettuce, pico de gallo and cheddar cheese for $5.49.

The chain is also offering two Crispy Chicken Strips for the price of $3.99, not to be confused with its Crispy Chicken Nuggets, which debuted last December and returned in April.

It always satisfied late-night cravings while going easy on your wallet–not to mention it was super convenient. But customers haven’t been happy with some of the menu items lately. Whether it’s changes in ingredients, preparation, or quality, some fans say certain menu staples have lost their edge. According to recent customer reviews, here are 5 Taco Bell items shoppers say are just not worth ordering anymore.

Chicken Strips

Taco Bell is known for a lot of tasty things, but the chicken strips isn’t one of the better menu items anymore, according to angry reviewers. A customer on Yelp shared photos and their order and we have to admit the chicken strips did not look edible. “Worst chicken “strips” ever. Don’t even bother at this location. Overcooked, hard, gross. Couldn’t even eat that small nugget one because it was so hard. Del Taco’s are way better.” Redditors also aren’t happy with the chicken fingers. A customer took to the site to share a photo and explain why the item was so terrible. “I tried the Taco Bell nuggets when those came out and thought they were ok, decent flavor but way too dry. I was hoping these would be a step up. Unfortunately they aren’t in my opinion. They taste the same, but are just as dry, if not more dry. Also, considering they charge $5.00 for 2 tiny tenders with no side item or anything , it makes them even more disappointing in my opinion. I remember when you could get a bag full of food for $5.00 at Taco Bell lol. Rating: 5 out of 10, I would not get these again.”

Nacho Fries

The Nacho Fries from Taco Bell are supposed to be seasoned fries with a side of nacho cheese dipping sauce, but customers are complaining about the taste and lack of quality. Yelp reviewer Matt C. from Lake Elsinore, CA wrote, “Worst nacho fries I had. Feel like they gave me the old ones sitting. Didn’t even warm them up for me..” On Reddit, a customer shared “Mine had no seasoning at all yesterday, just plain old fries” and another replied to the comment, “We take those back to the store.”

The Crunchwrap has been a menu staple, but customers have griped it’s not what it used to be. On Yelp, Shane L. from Huntington Beach, CA posted a photo of his order and wrote, “Terrible representation of a Crunchwrap! Not even a tablespoon of ground beef included. Pathetic. How hard is it to make these full with meat and everything instead of flat and awful like this one!? Avoid this place!” Redditors are also unhappy with the item and many say the quality has gone down. The Original Poster wrote, “Yeah I said it, it’s not what I remember it to be. Idk why but it just doesn’t live up to how I picture it from back when. In b4, add this add that double meat etc. nah it used to be good how it was. Also the box went up another $1 here in Atlanta. It will be a $10 box before the end of the year…sigh.” Another wrote, “The crunchwrap used to be amazing, but that was a very long time ago. Now, they’re not really even worth a $1 when they put them in the $1 drop.”6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

The Chalupa Supreme features a fried flatbread shell stuffed with beef and or chicken, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and sour cream. It’s been a fan favorite for years, but it’s no longer good, customers say. One Redditor wrote, “Just got a chalupa yesterday on a whim as I never get fast food. It was definitely much different from years ago. Taste/texture wasn’t even close.” In a separate Reddit thread, another customer shared. “I’ve ordered twice, and sadly disappointed both times chalupa shells were rock hard. Love the concept but the execution has let me down.”

The Mexican Pizza is one of the most beloved items at Taco Bell, but the former must-have item is not the same and tastes like “poison”, according to customers. The original poster on a Reddit thread shared a photo of the order and wrote, “The saddest Mexican Pizza. I said it tastes like poison, had my bf taste it, he said it tastes like a 2×4.” Another Redditor wrote, “I had a Mexican Pizza not long after it returned that tasted so bad and rancid that it ruined them for me.” A third shared, “I’ve had the same experience with TB before where the food tastes like cardboard or just ~off~, where you know something is immediately wrong with jt. Looked it up and found out it could be because of rancid fryer oil due to not changing it out often enough 🤢”"

From the record-breaking temperatures to sizzling menu collabs and swicy (that's sweet + spicy, in case you haven't heard) dishes, there's plenty to make you sweat this season. Luckily, Taco Bell is aiming to cool things off with its brand new Refrescas beverage lineup. Starting today, customers can choose from six new drinks that'll help to keep things chill—your mouth included—way past summer.

The new beverages come in an array of flavors and iterations—the Strawberry Passionfruit Agua Refresca, Dragonfruit Berry Agua Refresca, Mango Peach Agua Refresca, Pineapple Lime Rockstar Energy Refresca, Tropical Punch Rockstar Energy Refresca, and, lastly, the Refresca Freeze, which is a frozen take on the classic in a Strawberry Lime flavor. And when the heat has you losing steam, fret not—all the drinks are boosted with caffeine. The Agua Refrescas contain green tea syrup for a bit of a kick (51 mg caffeine, to be exact), while the Rockstar Energy Refrescas take it up a notch with 200 mg.

Amanda Mactas Strawberry Passionfruit Agua Refresca

I got to try these on the hottest day of the year so far to test off their cooling powers. The Agua Refrescas, created to pay homage to the classic Mexican drink, come mixed with freeze-dried fruit pieces on top. I personally found the Dragonfruit Berry flavor much too sweet for my palate, but my favorite was the Strawberry Passionfruit. This one tasted very juicy and fruity—the strawberry flavor was quite pronounced. The Mango Peach would've earned higher marks if it dialed up the mango a bit. The peach flavor was very noticeable, but it overwhelmed any other flavors mixed in there.

When it came to the Rockstar Energy Refrescas, I'll admit I was a bit intimidated. I avoid energy drinks like the plague (I'm quite sensitive to caffeine) and don't even drink coffee.

Amanda Mactas Rockstar Energy Tropical Punch Refresca

I was surprised to find that the Pineapple Lime flavor was not as offensive as I expected it to be. It wasn't bad, but I could taste the ""energy drink"" as an aftertaste, which I didn't love. The Tropical Punch, on the other hand, was sweet and refreshing; if you're looking for some extra oomph, this is the drink to get.

In addition to Taco Bell's new bevvies, its Live Más Café concept is expanding, with 30 new cafés opening up within existing Taco Bell locations across Texas and Southern California.

The first new Live Más Café is scheduled to open early next month in Orange, California, the company said in a recent news release. It comes after the success of the first test location, which opened in Chula Vista, California, in November 2024 under the operation of franchise partner Diversified Restaurant Group, which owns about 300 Taco Bells and 28 Arby's locations across the U.S.

By the end of the year, Taco Bell is planning to add 30 more Live Más Cafés, all part of the chain's attempt to respond to Generation Z's thirst for beverages – and grow its drink revenue to $5 billion by 2030.

“We’re seeing today that people, especially younger consumers, are reaching for refreshing drinks as part of their lifestyle, whether it’s for energy or a sweet treat throughout the day,” said Liz Matthews, Taco Bell’s global chief food innovation officer. “So, we’re making big investments to become the ultimate beverage stop where our fans can expect to see the same bold, unexpected creativity in their cups as they do on their plates.”

How much are Taco Bell Refrescas?

The Agua Refrescas cost $3.99 for a 20-ounce drink while the Rockstar Energy Refrescas cost $4.49 for a 20-ounce beverage. The Refrescas Freezes are available in a 16-ounce or 20-ounce option and cost $3.79 and $3.99, respectively.

Why is Taco Bell adding Refrescas to the menu?

Taco Bell is seemingly going after younger consumers searching for fresh beverage options.

“We’re seeing today that people, especially younger consumers, are reaching for refreshing drinks as part of their lifestyle, whether it’s for energy or a sweet treat throughout the day,” said Liz Matthews, Taco Bell’s Global Chief Food Innovation Officer, in the June 26 news release. “So, we’re making big investments to become the ultimate beverage stop where our fans can expect to see the same bold, unexpected creativity in their cups as they do on their plates.”

Taco Bell Refrescas do contain caffeine ranging from 52 mg to 200 mg. Healthy adults can generally consume up to 400 mg of caffeine per day without negative affects, according to the FDA. However, the FDA warns about heavy consumption of caffeine among children. ""Too much caffeine in children and teens can cause increased heart rate, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, anxiety, and lead to sleep problems, digestive problems and dehydration,"" the FDA says.

Taco Bell also debuts Crispy Chicken Tacos, Burritos and Strips

In addition to the new beverages, Taco Bell also announced last month that Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos will be available at locations nationwide for a limited time.

Both items feature a Crispy Chicken Strip inside and are available with new Spicy Ranchero and Avocado Ranch sauces.

For $2.79, the Crispy Chicken Tacos layers its new crispy strip with purple cabbage, lettuce, pico de gallo and shredded cheddar cheese. Meanwhile, the Crispy Chicken Burrito includes two strips, purple cabbage, crisp lettuce, pico de gallo and cheddar cheese for $5.49.

The chain is also offering two Crispy Chicken Strips for the price of $3.99, not to be confused with its Crispy Chicken Nuggets, which debuted last December and returned in April.

Why are the 10 chains unhealthy?

The ranking cited high calorie, sodium, saturated fat and sugar contents in menu items at the fast food chains, and lack of nutritional value. In many cases, the fast food meals surpassed recommended daily limits to maintain a healthy, balanced diet.

This poses serious health concerns as consuming excess of these elements can lead to higher risks of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, per the report. The report warns that 19.7% of children ages 2-19 in the U.S. are considered obese.

Fast food can raise your blood pressure due to its high sodium contents, cause bloating, increase your cholesterol from high saturated fat, lead to indigestion due to lack of fiber, lead to weight gain due to bigger portions and high sugar content, spike your blood sugar and lack nutrients, the Cleveland Clinic says.

Platinum symbolizes strength and china symbolizes tradition, which seem at odds because platinum is modern and china is fragile. Still, if there’s one entity that can unite these contradictory elements in a toasted tortilla, it’s the Crunchwrap, Taco Bell’s durable yet delicate prize, which descended upon the consumer snackscape on June 22, 2005.

That particular June 22 was a Wednesday. “We Belong Together” by Mariah Carey was the No. 1 song in America and the Republican-controlled Senate had just passed an amendment to the 2005 Energy Policy Act, which provided funds for investments in renewable energy, by a now unimaginable vote of 66 to 29. That night, the Houston Astros beat the Colorado Rockies 6-2 after seven strong innings of one-run ball from their 43-year-old ace, Roger Clemens.

In other words, these were times of minor miracles. And the fact that the Crunchwrap reached consumers at all was another one. The Crunchwrap concept had languished in development for a decade as corporate recipe developers at Yum! Brands’ Taco Bell labored to turn a folded tortilla into a structural masterpiece that could be reproduced tens of thousands of times a day around the country. The final result was near perfection; another gem from another 43-year-old ace in another major league. It became the fastest-selling menu item in the chain’s history, moving 51 million units in its first six weeks.

Ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Crunchwrap’s launch, several major publications — no doubt spurred by some savvy PR outreach from Irvine — assessed the particular genius of the Crunchwrap. But rather than celebrate its innovative combination of soft tortilla and crunchy tostada or marvel at its elusive and highly useful portability, many framed the Crunchwrap’s importance in terms of its influence beyond its steady presence on Taco Bell’s ever-changing menu boards.

In The New York Times, one writer outlined how the Crunchwrap (a “fast-food gimmick”) became “an unlikely muse for chefs”:

“Twenty years later, it is as much a novelty food as a playful framework for chefs. They reinterpret its nostalgic layers — ground beef, nacho cheese, a tostada shell, lettuce, tomato and sour cream enrobed by a 12-inch flour tortilla — with ingredients that are deeply personal.”

The piece goes on to describe how chefs from different culinary traditions have made their own riffs on the Crunchwrap, from bulgogi and carnitas to shawarma and Thai basil chicken.

The Times piece, even as it drew distinctions between the praiseworthy personal (chef-made) Crunchwraps and the mass-produced corporate original, was respectful about the work that went into creating a wildly influential food item. Still, the story, just by its framing, does the classic a disservice.

Many years ago, I had drinks with Chef Scott Uehlein, who left the gilded kitchen at the exclusive wellness retreat Canyon Ranch to become the head of menu at fast-food chain Sonic. What struck me most about his career journey was listening to him describe what it meant to create dishes that would reach more diners in an hour at Sonic than they would in a year at CanRan. At the time, Sonic had just released “blended burgers,” which mixed ground beef with mushrooms to cut down on both the calories and fat as well as the environmental impact of all-beef burgers. He was proud to have a direct line to the mainstream and the influence to shape it as much as the market would allow.

When publications start delving into the terrain of elevated food, which is meant to delineate the basic from the enlightened, something deeply irritating happens. In this world, those with money, access, and taste know better than to suffer the appetites of the unsophisticated. New York Magazine’s Grubstreet, for example, begins its Crunchwrap anniversary coverage with an anecdote involving a chef sitting at a Taco Bell in Lower Manhattan, skeptically pondering a Crunchwrap:

“After he opened his Mission-style burrito chain’s first brick-and-mortar store in the Rockaways in 2020 and began offering specials to survive winter lulls, dozens of customers peppered his Instagram account with requests to make a Crunchwrap dupe. ‘I really didn’t want to do a Taco Bell thing,’ he says. ‘I’m trying to make this food that’s very precious to me and who I am.’ …a self-described people pleaser, [he] managed to ignore and delete the pleading messages for eight months before finally caving. ‘I was like, You know what, fuck it — give the people what they want.’”

Reader, you’ll never guess what happened next. His riff on the benighted mass-market concept that he finally deigned to emulate was a huge hit.

The Grubstreet piece — saddled with the absurd subhead, “How the tortilla-wrapped griddled tostada became bigger than the chain that invented it” — goes on to track down a chef who made a Crunchwrap dupe despite never bothering to try the original. “...people see it on a menu and they’re like, ‘Wow, this is, like, so much better than Taco Bell,’” another chef with a Crunchwrap knockoff crows.

There’s a bigger lesson here. As everyone from small-fry chefs and home cooks to professional chefs and major outlets follow the lead of big brands by concocting vegan Crunchwraps or better Big Macs, there are still people for whom the genuine articles have meaning — be that as an indulgence, a tradition, a last resort, or quick and affordable means to an end. All of these options have their merits. Even with a proliferation of dupes, Taco Bell sells 100 million Crunchwraps every year and McDonald’s sells 550 million Big Macs annually in the US alone.

“We’re seeing today that people, especially younger consumers, are reaching for refreshing drinks as part of their lifestyle, whether it’s for energy or a sweet treat throughout the day,” said Liz Matthews, Taco Bell’s global chief food innovation officer. “So, we’re making big investments to become the ultimate beverage stop where our fans can expect to see the same bold, unexpected creativity in their cups as they do on their plates.”

The company announced on June 26 it was introducing new beverages called Refrescas to menus nationwide. According to the chain, the drinks are crafted to ""quench every kind of craving – whether you're seeking a refreshing sip, an energizing boost or a frozen escape.""

The six drinks include three refreshers, two energy drinks and a cooling freeze. According to Taco Bell, the three Agua Refrescas join menus permanently after initially being tested in Southern California in 2024, with a positive response.

How much are Taco Bell Refrescas?

The Agua Refrescas cost $3.99 for a 20-ounce drink while the Rockstar Energy Refrescas cost $4.49 for a 20-ounce beverage. The Refrescas Freezes are available in a 16-ounce or 20-ounce option and cost $3.79 and $3.99, respectively.

Why is Taco Bell adding Refrescas to the menu?

Taco Bell is seemingly going after younger consumers searching for fresh beverage options.

“We’re seeing today that people, especially younger consumers, are reaching for refreshing drinks as part of their lifestyle, whether it’s for energy or a sweet treat throughout the day,” said Liz Matthews, Taco Bell’s Global Chief Food Innovation Officer, in the June 26 news release. “So, we’re making big investments to become the ultimate beverage stop where our fans can expect to see the same bold, unexpected creativity in their cups as they do on their plates.”

Taco Bell Refrescas do contain caffeine ranging from 52 mg to 200 mg. Healthy adults can generally consume up to 400 mg of caffeine per day without negative affects, according to the FDA. However, the FDA warns about heavy consumption of caffeine among children. ""Too much caffeine in children and teens can cause increased heart rate, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, anxiety, and lead to sleep problems, digestive problems and dehydration,"" the FDA says.

Taco Bell also debuts Crispy Chicken Tacos, Burritos and Strips

In addition to the new beverages, Taco Bell also announced last month that Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos will be available at locations nationwide for a limited time.

Both items feature a Crispy Chicken Strip inside and are available with new Spicy Ranchero and Avocado Ranch sauces.

For $2.79, the Crispy Chicken Tacos layers its new crispy strip with purple cabbage, lettuce, pico de gallo and shredded cheddar cheese. Meanwhile, the Crispy Chicken Burrito includes two strips, purple cabbage, crisp lettuce, pico de gallo and cheddar cheese for $5.49.

The chain is also offering two Crispy Chicken Strips for the price of $3.99, not to be confused with its Crispy Chicken Nuggets, which debuted last December and returned in April.

“I found out a man was pretty hostile. I think that’s pretty insane. I think that’s sad. That’s also pretty dangerous on his part and for everyone involved,” Jai Tiger said.

Customer Brenda Williams said, “The way I look at it now, we are in this crazy world now. We all gotta be prayed up. We don’t know what we dealing with, who we working with.”

So, what set the man off?

Dearborn Heights Police Chief Ahmed Haidar explained, ""So, he came in pretty upset that he’s been reaching out to that Taco Bell for the last week or so, trying to communicate on his cellphone and he wasn’t getting any response from them.”

He said the 18-year-old decided to show up on-site.

“(He) brandished a weapon at the time. Two times, exited came back in, flipped over a table,"" Haidar said.

After fleeing the Taco Bell, the chief said officers caught up with the man a couple of blocks away and recovered a BB gun.

“(He) doesn’t have a history. Sounds like he’s a 18-year-old kid that’s on a downslide right now. He’s just trying to find a job, trying to do right. Made a poor decision,"" he said.

The new sauce is coming out just in time to complement the chain’s fan-favorite and wildly popular Crispy Chicken menu, which features tortilla chip-coated Crispy Chicken Tacos, Burritos, and Strips. (We’re quite familiar with how well a good barbecue sauce dips alongside a crispy chicken strip, mind you.)

You can find Sweet Chipotle BBQ Sauce accompanying the new Crispy Chicken Taco in harmony with Spicy Ranch or Avocado Ranch; with the Crispy Chicken Burrito, also alongside your ranch of choice; and on the new Sweet Chipotle BBQ Sauce Topped Fries—topped with nacho cheese and slow-roasted chicken. You can also add the sauce to any menu item of your choosing for 30 cents or in a soufflé cup on the side for 60 cents. Not a bad deal for layers of flavor!

Taco Bell customers can expect to see new dishes at a reasonable price thanks to a brand new offering.

The fast food chain announced Thursday that it's adding a new deal in stores: The Luxe Value Menu. The meu is packed “with premium flavors and bold formats,” according to the news release, and each item is priced at $3 or less.

“From handheld stacks to indulgent dips, the Luxe Value Menu test is built to satisfy every craving — and proves fans can have it all: flavor, variety, innovation, and value,” the company said in the press release.

However, the Luxe Value Menu will be tested only at select locations across Indianapolis, Indiana, starting Thursday, while supplies last. Future plans for the menu have not yet been announced.

There are five items in the lineup, including a Mini Taco Salad, which is “seasoned beef, chipotle sauce, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and refried beans in a crispy, golden tortilla bowl.”

The second item is a Chipotle Ranch Chicken Stacker, which has grilled all-white-meat chicken, a three-cheese blend, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado ranch sauce, and chipotle sauce. Those ingredients are then folded into Taco Bell’s stacker format of a flour tortilla.

A third item on the menu is the Beefy Potato Loaded Griller. This is a rolled-up tortilla filled with beef, crispy potato bites, nacho cheese sauce, chipotle sauce, and sour cream.

The fourth new item is a Chips & Nacho Supreme Dip, which is layers of beef, beans, nacho cheese sauce, sour cream, pico de gallo, and a three-cheese blend. It’s, of course, served with a side of chips.

The final item is a sweet treat, Salted Caramel Churros. The inside of the churros is creamy, while the outside is covered in salted caramel sugar.

Taco Bell has other “luxe” deals nationwide, specifically the Luxe Cravings Box. This includes the $5 classic box, which has a 5-Layer Beef Burrito, Crunchy Taco, Cinnamon Twists, and a medium drink.

The brand also has the $7 Supreme Luxe Cravings Box, featuring a Chicken Chalupa Supreme, 5-Layer Beef Burrito, Crunchy Taco, Chips & Nacho Cheese sauce, and a medium drink. A third option is the $9 Discovery Luxe Cravings Box, which has a Crispy Chicken Burrito, Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Tacos, Crunchy Taco, Cinnamon Twists, and a medium drink.

The new Luxe Value Menu comes after Taco Bell leaned into offering another beloved food: Crispy Chicken. In June, the company introduced a crispy chicken taco for $2.79, a crispy chicken burrito for $5.49, and crispy chicken strips, which include two pieces for $3.99. This came shortly after the brand offered a limited release of its crispy chicken nuggets, which quickly sold out when they first launched in December.

“Crispy chicken is having a moment, but our fans made it a movement,” Taylor Montgomery, Chief Marketing Officer at Taco Bell, said in a press release last month. “So, we decided to bring our sell-out Nuggets recipe to the formats that defined our brand because true innovation means elevating the icons, not replacing them. We’re not like every other chicken spot out there, we’re doing crispy chicken the only way we know how: full of flavor and unmistakably Taco Bell.”"

Key Points

Taco Bell is testing a new Luxe Value Menu featuring five items priced at $2.99 each, available only at select locations.

The test menu is part of the chain’s broader value-focused strategy, aimed at appealing to budget-conscious consumers during the ongoing fast food “value wars.”

Additionally, a new Sweet Chipotle Barbecue Sauce is launching nationwide, offering a smoky-sweet flavor profile that adds a bold twist to Taco Bell’s lineup.





Taco Bell is testing a new lineup of five value snacks, all priced under $3. And there’s lots of budget-friendly deliciousness to savor — from a barbecue sauce-covered fry platter to crispy burritos.

The Luxe Value Menu is now available starting today, but with one caveat: For now, it’s only offered at select Indianapolis-area locations. It features five new items, including a returning fan-favorite, that cost just $2.99 each.

Here’s the rundown: The Mini Taco Salad stands as the crown jewel of the test menu. This portable version of the nostalgic classic has all the fixings (seasoned beef, chipotle sauce, shredded cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and refried beans) encased in a crispy tortilla bowl.

There’s also the Chipotle Ranch Chicken Stacker, the Beefy Potato Loaded Griller, and the Chips & Nacho Supreme Dip. On the sweet side, Taco Bell beckons diners to round out that value meal with the $3 Salted Caramel Churros, a “street food-inspired dessert” coated in salted caramel sugar.

Nowhere near Indianapolis? Not to worry. Another new item is headed to Taco Bell locations nationwide, showcasing a saucy new flavor. The Sweet Chipotle Barbecue Sauce is set to debut on national menus today. You'll find it on the under-$3 Crispy Chicken Taco, as well as the burritos and chicken strips.

Topped Nacho Fries, on the other hand, offers a sweet-and-smoky spin on the fan-favorite crispy potatoes. It’s built from a base of seasoned fries, topped with roasted chicken, nacho cheese, Spicy Ranch, Sweet Chipotle barbecue Sauce, and jalapeños. I’ve never personally thought about adding barbecue sauce to burritos and quesadillas, but maybe it’s time to try.

We’re two years deep into the fast food “value wars,” so Taco Bell’s latest strategy isn’t particularly surprising. The chain, founded in 1962, has been a consistent ally to budget-conscious crowds, making it an irresistible stop for cash-strapped college students and thrifty food enthusiasts alike. This newest menu, down to the “Luxe” in its name, promises better value and innovation at an ultra-low price.

During the chain’s annual Live Más conference in March, executives teased a year's worth of upcoming launches at Taco Bell. In the coming months, diners can look forward to a variety of new innovations (Caliente Cantina Chicken, you’re on notice) and the return of throwbacks like the Doritos Locos Taco. The nostalgic Mini Taco Salad was part of the brand’s 2025 preview, which further confirms that we can trust Taco Bell to keep its promises.

Taco Bell fans asked for cheaper menu prices but, instead, they're getting new drink options.

In fact, if you're a Taco Bell fan in general, get ready to be inundated with beverages for the foreseeable future as the company has announced a new strategic business move that will place a major emphasis on the liquid side of things.

According to a press release, Taco Bell says it is ""doubling down on the beverage category with the national launch of Refrescas."" Six new drinks - including three that will be permanently placed on the menu — are part of the company's plan to reach $5 billion in beverage sales by 2030.

TACO BELL INTRODUCES SIX NEW MOCKTAIL OPTIONS

That's great and all, but will diehard Taco Bell fans actually care about going to the Tex-Mex spot for a drink instead of some delicious tacos or quesadillas? The company believes so, and is looking to compete against McDonald's and other food chains that now offer a variety of drinks on their menus.

Taco Bell's new drinks began rolling out a few weeks ago and fans will be able to enjoy one of the following new cocktails according to their official website:

- Agua Refrescas : A Taco Bell twist on the beloved Mexican beverage, mixed with real freeze-dried fruit pieces** and green tea to provide a subtle boost of caffeine (52mg per beverage). These vibrant drinks are available in Strawberry Passionfruit, Dragonfruit Berry, and Mango Peach.

- Rockstar Energy® Refrescas: Fans can turn up the energy with a Pineapple Lime or Tropical Punch RockstarEnergy® Refresca — flavors curated exclusively for Taco Bell. With 200mg of caffeine, each drink delivers a delicious boost of energy.

- Refresca Freeze: Taco Bell’s newest Freeze is a frozen take on the Refresca line-up, featuring real freeze-dried fruit pieces, and turns up Strawberry Lime flavor for maximum cool down.

If that wasn't enough, the fast food chain is set to launch 30 new Live Más Cafés, which are essentially beverage pop-up locations.

Never one to lose a chance at clever marketing (where is the Chihuahua though?!), the Bell is calling their version of baristas, ""Bellristas."" Well played.

TACO BELL EXPANDS BEVERAGE SIDE OF THINGS

""We’re seeing today that people, especially younger consumers, are reaching for refreshing drinks as part of their lifestyle, whether it’s for energy or a sweet treat throughout the day,"" Taco Bell’s Global Chief Food Innovation Officer said in a statement. ""So, we’re making big investments to become the ultimate beverage stop where our fans can expect to see the same bold, unexpected creativity in their cups as they do on their plates.""

As a self-proclaimed Taco Bell connoisseur who has written about his love of the fast-food chain for years, I don't mind the new mocktails so long as I don't have to start standing in line next to some holier-than-thou, Starbucks snobs. Sorry, but I'm very protective of my Nacho Fries.

But really, can we just bring back cheap tacos again?"

""We’re seeing today that people, especially younger consumers, are reaching for refreshing drinks as part of their lifestyle, whether it’s for energy or a sweet treat,"" said Liz Matthews, Taco Bell’s Global Chief Food Innovation Officer in a statement. Following successful limited-time tests, Refrescas are now on menus nationwide, though officially for “a limited time only, while supplies last.” Prices might vary depending on location.

But Taco Bell’s drink strategy goes beyond new flavors. By the end of the year, the chain plans to add 30 more Live Más Cafés inside existing restaurants across Southern California and Texas.

Why is Taco Bell adding Refrescas to the menu?

Taco Bell is seemingly going after younger consumers searching for fresh beverage options.

“We’re seeing today that people, especially younger consumers, are reaching for refreshing drinks as part of their lifestyle, whether it’s for energy or a sweet treat throughout the day,” said Liz Matthews, Taco Bell’s Global Chief Food Innovation Officer, in the June 26 news release. “So, we’re making big investments to become the ultimate beverage stop where our fans can expect to see the same bold, unexpected creativity in their cups as they do on their plates.”

Taco Bell Refrescas do contain caffeine ranging from 52 mg to 200 mg. Healthy adults can generally consume up to 400 mg of caffeine per day without negative affects, according to the FDA. However, the FDA warns about heavy consumption of caffeine among children. ""Too much caffeine in children and teens can cause increased heart rate, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, anxiety, and lead to sleep problems, digestive problems and dehydration,"" the FDA says.

Taco Bell also debuts Crispy Chicken Tacos, Burritos and Strips

In addition to the new beverages, Taco Bell also announced last month that Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos will be available at locations nationwide for a limited time.

Both items feature a Crispy Chicken Strip inside and are available with new Spicy Ranchero and Avocado Ranch sauces.

For $2.79, the Crispy Chicken Tacos layers its new crispy strip with purple cabbage, lettuce, pico de gallo and shredded cheddar cheese. Meanwhile, the Crispy Chicken Burrito includes two strips, purple cabbage, crisp lettuce, pico de gallo and cheddar cheese for $5.49.

The chain is also offering two Crispy Chicken Strips for the price of $3.99, not to be confused with its Crispy Chicken Nuggets, which debuted last December and returned in April.
